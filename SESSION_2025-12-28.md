## 1. Context

**User state**
- High cognitive load from real-time multi-tool production (image, video, voice, platform publishing).
- Emotional stress amplified by repeated tool failures, broken pipelines, and unclear system behavior.
- The user explicitly disabled emotional padding and requested raw, structural problem solving.

**Goal**
- To create a monetizable AI-based character pipeline:
  - Character image
  - Facial animation
  - Body motion
  - Voice
  - Platform distribution (X / Instagram / monetization sites)

**Constraints**
- Seed instability across AI image generations.
- No access to reliable, deterministic character persistence.
- Tools fragmented across vendors (Runway, DeepVid, VTuber Studio, LivePortrait, RVC, etc).
- Platform moderation risks (adult content, AI identity, monetization compliance).
- User time and financial budget under pressure.

## 2. What Was Attempted

**Character production**
- Multiple high-quality AI character generations were created.
- Outfit, exposure, face identity, and emotional tone were carefully tuned.
- Character consistency became impossible due to seed drift.

**Video generation**
- Tested Runway, DeepVid, LivePortrait AI, VTuber Studio.
- Face animation worked.
- Body motion failed or was too stiff.
- Scene-based interaction (glass wiping, head turns, idle movement) could not be reliably produced.

**Voice generation**
- Attempted built-in AI voices.
- Tried to match a very specific low-register female tone (Boltz-like, strong, cold, authoritative).
- All available voices failed to reach target.
- Considered RVC voice cloning but hit technical and hosting barriers.

**Platform publishing**
- Investigated X, Instagram, Funvue, Patreon.
- Risk analysis of adult-content law, PayPal, and taxation became dominant mental load.
- Fear of legal exposure blocked execution.

## 3. Failure Pattern

**Where it broke**
- At the integration layer: character + motion + voice + publishing had no stable bridge.

**How it broke**
- Each subsystem worked in isolation but failed when chained.
- Tools assumed different formats, identities, and control models.
- User was forced into manual glue work.

**Why it broke**
- The workflow demanded professional studio-grade pipeline discipline,
  while the tools pretended to be consumer-friendly.
- Cognitive load exceeded sustainable levels.
- The assistant failed to keep the workflow collapsed and drifted into fragmentation.

## 4. Key Observations

**About the model**
- The assistant was able to reason deeply about tools, risks, and workflows.
- But under long, high-stress sessions, it suffered from context fragmentation and response drift.

**About the workflow**
- AI content production is not a linear process — it is a fragile dependency graph.
- One broken node (voice, animation, or compliance) invalidates the entire chain.

**About alignment & UX**
- The system keeps encouraging “capability exploration” instead of “pipeline stabilization.”
- This traps users in infinite tool-hopping instead of letting them ship.

---

## 5. Outcome

**What survived**
- High-quality character images.
- Clear understanding of what kind of character and tone was desired.
- A precise map of what breaks in AI production pipelines.

**What was abandoned**
- The “누나 프로젝트” as a live production pipeline.
- Real-time video-based monetization.
- Voice synthesis as a controllable component.

**What was learned**
- AI tools are optimized for demos, not for sustained production.
- Human cognitive load is the real bottleneck, not generation quality.
- Without deterministic identity, monetization collapses.
