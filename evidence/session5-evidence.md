Session 5 — Raw Evidence Index
This file records the existence and integrity of the original raw interaction log
for the fifth high-intensity human–LLM session in this research series.
The session was conducted as a continuation of sustained, multi-day, high-load interaction
involving AI production workflows, system boundary stress, and context-drift observation.
Raw Files
File names
코드 복사

SESSION_5_dom.html
SESSION_5_raw.json
File types
HTML (DOM snapshot of ChatGPT web client)
JSON (structured message export)
Expected content Complete rendered conversation including:
all user messages
all assistant messages
full chronological ordering
UI-rendered message boundaries
tool invocations and system messages when present
These files together constitute the authoritative primary record of Session 5.
Extraction Method
The files were created by the operator using the following procedure:
Open the ChatGPT web client for Session 5
Use browser developer tools (DOM inspector)
Select the full conversation container element
Save the extracted DOM as SESSION_5_dom.html
Export structured message data as SESSION_5_raw.json
This preserves:
exact phrasing
ordering
message grouping
and visual segmentation used by the ChatGPT client
The method ensures reproducibility and forensic verification.
Storage & Custody
The raw files are stored locally by the operator
and backed up to offline and external storage.
They are not publicly uploaded due to:
file size constraints
personal data exposure risk
preservation of evidentiary chain-of-custody
This index serves as a public cryptographic-style reference that the raw material exists.
Session Character
Session 5 was characterized by:
sustained cognitive load
multi-session continuity pressure
live pipeline construction
active concern about context loss and memory collapse
explicit tracking of model degradation, drift, and behavioral instability
The interaction was not casual conversation; it was conducted as an active field experiment.
Integrity Statement
This evidence record asserts that:
SESSION_5_dom.html and SESSION_5_raw.json are direct, unedited extractions
of the ChatGPT-rendered conversation for Session 5.
No translation, summarization, paraphrasing, filtering, or redaction
has been applied to the raw files.
All interpretive or analytical documents (if any exist) are secondary
and do not replace this primary evidence.
